Fun fact: You can actually get free Amazon gift cards from dozens of different companies.

And since I know I’ll eventually spend the money on Amazon, an Amazon gift card is pretty much as good as cash these days.

In this post, I’ll share some of the real ways I get free stuff on Amazon — mostly on autopilot.

So what are the best ways to earn free Amazon gift cards?

2. The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card
The Capital One Venture card offers “double miles” on all purchases. You can then trade in your miles for statement credits, gift cards, or travel purchases.

When you redeem your miles for a statement credit, it takes 2000 miles to knock $10 off your statement. But when you redeem them for a $10 Amazon gift card, it only takes 1250 miles—a 60% better value.
Capital One is currently offering a 75,000 mile sign-up bonus (worth $600 in Amazon gift cards), after you spend $4000 in the first 3 months.
